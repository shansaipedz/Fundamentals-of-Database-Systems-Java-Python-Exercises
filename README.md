# 🗃️ Fundamentals of Database Systems – Java & Python Exercises

## Description

This repository contains exercises, sample codes, and notes created as part of the **Fundamentals of Database Systems** course in an IT program. It includes a mix of **Java** and **Python** programs that interface with databases, as well as raw **SQL practice queries**. The focus is on building a foundational understanding of how to model, query, and interact with relational databases using programming languages.

These exercises demonstrate core database concepts such as data modeling, SQL syntax, query logic, relationships, joins, subqueries, and simple integrations with backend code.

## Contents

### 📌 SQL Practice

* Table creation and population (`students`, `subjects`, `enroll`)
* `SELECT`, `INSERT`, and nested queries
* Subqueries and derived tables
* Aggregation using `SUM()`
* Join operations and filtering

### 💻 Java Exercises

* Console-based programs to simulate data operations
* Basic object manipulation and output formatting
* Could include database connectivity in JDBC format (if applicable)

### 🐍 Python Exercises

* May include scripts that interface with databases (via `sqlite3` or similar modules)
* Ideal for automating queries and managing data through scripting

> 📄 *Refer to `notes.txt` for practical SQL scenarios and query examples.*

## Learning Objectives

* Understand and apply relational database concepts
* Practice SQL for data manipulation and retrieval
* Use Java and Python to work with structured data
* Reinforce backend logic tied to database transactions

## File Structure (Sample)

```bash
.
├── notes.txt             # SQL command examples and notes
├── exer4.java            # Java logic or database-related exercise
├── 2ndTable.java         # Java array or table-style display logic
├── db_connection.py      # (If applicable) Python DB connector script
```

## Technologies Used

* Java (JDK 8+)
* Python 3.x
* MySQL / SQLite
* SQL (Structured Query Language)

## Use Cases

* Classroom review and practice
